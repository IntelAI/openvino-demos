# OpenVINO™ Demos

Following are two [sample Jupyter notebooks](#) provided as reference to use OpenVINO™.

1. [InceptionV3](inceptionv3/OpenVINO-Inceptionv3.ipynb) for general computer vision-based applications.
2. [Salt Identification](salt/OpenVINO-Salt.ipynb) in seismic data. This notebook uses a 3D CNN based model3 on data from the [F3 Dutch block](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/Netherlands-Offshore-F3-Block-Complete) in the North Sea to identify salts. Salt-bodies are important subsurface structures with significant implications for hydrocarbon accumulation and sealing in petroleum reservoirs. On the other hand, if Salts are not recognized prior to drilling, they can lead to number of complications if encountered unexpectedly while drilling the well. The ability to quickly launch OpenVINO™ enabled instances in AWS to perform automatic quick look seismic interpretation from a pre-trained model will help geoscientists in reducing time to the first oil.
